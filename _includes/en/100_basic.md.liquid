This **step-be-step** guide will show you how to build an image using werf and run a container based on the built image locally. Then we proceed to deploy our application to Kubernetes.

## The application

We will use a tiny shell-script as an example application. This script returns `pong` in response to a request to the `/ping` endpoint. In the "Real-life applications" chapter, we will replace this shell-script with a {{ page.framework_name }} application. We will gradually add new functionality to it with each new chapter, eventually getting an app that resembles the real-life one.
