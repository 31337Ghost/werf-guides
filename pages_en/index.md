                    <p>This tutorial provides reasonably detailed information that combines the <b>theory and practice</b> of development (Dev) and operation (Ops).</p>
                    <p>Its contents are aimed at developers seeking to acquire basic DevOps skills in organizing the continuous delivery of applications to Kubernetes. The DevOps engineers who want to solve their tasks more efficiently will also benefit from this tutorial.</p>
                    <p>We will gradually consider all the tasks related to&nbsp;developing services and implementing the CI/CD process: <b>building</b>, <b>deploying</b>, <b>working with dependencies and&nbsp;assets</b>, <b>working with databases and&nbsp;in-memory storage</b>, <b>using e-mail and&nbsp;file storage</b>, <b>implementing autotests</b>, and&nbsp;more.</p>
                    <p>Each version of&nbsp;the&nbsp;tutorial takes into account the specifics of the programming language/framework and includes examples of the application source code and infrastructure (IaC).</p>
                    <p><i>This tutorial is based on a&nbsp;plain "vanilla" Kubernetes cluster. However, you can easily adapt it for&nbsp;custom builds.</i></p>
